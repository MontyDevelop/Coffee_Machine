# Coffee Machine in Python ‚òïÔ∏è

This project is a Python implementation of a Coffee Machine that simulates the functionality of a real-world coffee machine. It allows users to select from a variety of coffee options, manage resources, and process payments. The program is written in an easy-to-understand manner, making it ideal for beginners learning Python or object-oriented programming.

# Features
üçµ Menu Options: Choose from different types of coffee (e.g., Espresso, Latte, Cappuccino).
üîÑ Resource Management: Tracks ingredients like water, milk, and coffee to ensure proper availability.
üí∞ Payment System: Accepts coins and calculates total cost with change return functionality.
üîí Admin Mode: View resource levels and refill resources as needed.
# How It Works
The program displays a menu with coffee options and their prices.
Users can select their desired coffee.
The program checks if there are enough resources to make the selected coffee.
If resources are sufficient, the user is prompted to insert coins, and the total is calculated.
Once the payment is successful, the coffee is prepared, and the resources are updated.
# Technologies Used
Python: The entire program is implemented in Python, focusing on simplicity and modularity.
# Learning Highlights
This project demonstrates:

Using functions and classes to structure code.
Managing user inputs and resource constraints in a logical flow.
Implementing a basic payment system with change calculation.
Practicing OOP concepts like encapsulation and modular design.
